Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

* [[Adapter]] - Allows to connect two incompatible objects via another one interface
* [[Bridge]] - lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
* [[Composite]] - lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
* [[Decorator]] - lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
* [[Facade]] - provides a simplified interface to a liblary, a framework or any other complex set of classes.
* [[Flyweight]] - lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
* [[Proxy]] - lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

When you call a shop to place a phone order, an operator is your facade to all services and departments of the shop. The operator provides you with a simple voice interface to the ordering system, payment gateways, and various delivery services.


## Structure

![[Screenshot 2022-10-30 at 16.06.44.png]]

1. The **Facade** provides convinient access to a particular part of the subsystem's functionality. It knows where to direct the client's request and how to operate all the moving parts.
2. An **Additional Facade** class can be created to prevent polluting a single facade with unrelated features that might make it yet another complex structure. Additional facades can be used by both clients and other facades.
3. The **Complex sybstem** consists of dozens of various objects. To make them all do something meaningful, you have to dive deep into the subsystem implementation's details, such as initializing objects in the correct order and and suplying them with data in the proper format. Subsystem classes aren’t aware of the facade’s existence. They operate within the system and work with each other directly.
4. The **client** uses the Facade instead of calling the subsystem objects directly.


## How to Implement

1. Check whether it’s possible to provide a simpler interface than what an existing subsystem already provides. You’re on the right track if this interface makes the client code independent from many of the subsystem’s classes.
2. Declare and implement this interface in a new facade class. The facade should redirect the calls from the client code to appropriate objects of the subsystem. The facade should be responsible for initializing the subsystem and managing its further life cycle unless the client code already does this.
3. To get the full benefit from the pattern, make all the client code communicate with the subsystem only via the facade. Now the client code is protected from any changes in the subsystem code. For example, when a subsystem gets upgraded to a new version, you will only need to modify the code in the facade.
4. If the facade becomes too big, consider extracting part of its behavior to a new, refined facade class

## How to implement in [[Rust]] language
`pub struct WalletFacade` hides a complex logic behind its API. A single method `add_money_to_wallet` interacts with the account, code, wallet, notification and ledger behind the scenes.

#### **wallet_facade.rs**
```rust
use crate::{
    account::Account, ledger::Ledger, notification::Notification, security_code::SecurityCode,
    wallet::Wallet,
};

/// Facade hides a complex logic behind the API.
pub struct WalletFacade {
    account: Account,
    wallet: Wallet,
    code: SecurityCode,
    notification: Notification,
    ledger: Ledger,
}

impl WalletFacade {
    pub fn new(account_id: String, code: u32) -> Self {
        println!("Starting create account");

        let this = Self {
            account: Account::new(account_id),
            wallet: Wallet::new(),
            code: SecurityCode::new(code),
            notification: Notification,
            ledger: Ledger,
        };

        println!("Account created");
        this
    }

    pub fn add_money_to_wallet(
        &mut self,
        account_id: &String,
        security_code: u32,
        amount: u32,
    ) -> Result<(), String> {
        println!("Starting add money to wallet");
        self.account.check(account_id)?;
        self.code.check(security_code)?;
        self.wallet.credit_balance(amount);
        self.notification.send_wallet_credit_notification();
        self.ledger.make_entry(account_id, "credit".into(), amount);
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn deduct_money_from_wallet(
        &mut self,
        account_id: &String,
        security_code: u32,
        amount: u32,
    ) -> Result<(), String> {
        println!("Starting debit money from wallet");
        self.account.check(account_id)?;
        self.code.check(security_code)?;
        self.wallet.debit_balance(amount);
        self.notification.send_wallet_debit_notification();
        self.ledger.make_entry(account_id, "debit".into(), amount);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```


#### **wallet.rs**
```rust
pub struct Wallet {
    balance: u32,
}

impl Wallet {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self { balance: 0 }
    }

    pub fn credit_balance(&mut self, amount: u32) {
        self.balance += amount;
    }

    pub fn debit_balance(&mut self, amount: u32) {
        self.balance
            .checked_sub(amount)
            .expect("Balance is not sufficient");
    }
}
```


####  **account.rs**
```rust
pub struct Account {
    name: String,
}

impl Account {
    pub fn new(name: String) -> Self {
        Self { name }
    }

    pub fn check(&self, name: &String) -> Result<(), String> {
        if &self.name != name {
            return Err("Account name is incorrect".into());
        }

        println!("Account verified");
        Ok(())
    }
}
```


#### **edger.rs**
```rust
pub struct Ledger;

impl Ledger {
    pub fn make_entry(&mut self, account_id: &String, txn_type: String, amount: u32) {
        println!(
            "Make ledger entry for accountId {} with transaction type {} for amount {}",
            account_id, txn_type, amount
        );
    }
}
```


#### **notification.rs**
```rust
pub struct Notification;

impl Notification {
    pub fn send_wallet_credit_notification(&self) {
        println!("Sending wallet credit notification");
    }

    pub fn send_wallet_debit_notification(&self) {
        println!("Sending wallet debit notification");
    }
}
```


#### **security_code.rs**
```rust
pub struct SecurityCode {
    code: u32,
}

impl SecurityCode {
    pub fn new(code: u32) -> Self {
        Self { code }
    }

    pub fn check(&self, code: u32) -> Result<(), String> {
        if self.code != code {
            return Err("Security code is incorrect".into());
        }

        println!("Security code verified");
        Ok(())
    }
}
```


#### **main.rs**
```rust
mod account;
mod ledger;
mod notification;
mod security_code;
mod wallet;
mod wallet_facade;

use wallet_facade::WalletFacade;

fn main() -> Result<(), String> {
    let mut wallet = WalletFacade::new("abc".into(), 1234);
    println!();

    // Wallet Facade interacts with the account, code, wallet, notification and
    // ledger behind the scenes.
    wallet.add_money_to_wallet(&"abc".into(), 1234, 10)?;
    println!();

    wallet.deduct_money_from_wallet(&"abc".into(), 1234, 5)
}
```

### Output
```
Starting create account
Account created

Starting add money to wallet
Account verified
Security code verified
Sending wallet credit notification
Make ledger entry for accountId abc with transaction type credit for amount 10

Starting debit money from wallet
